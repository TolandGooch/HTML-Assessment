# HTML-Assessment

This program is to learn the structure and formatting of HTML. The importance of learning HTML was that it provides the audience with  
a visually pleasing display. Some of the HTML styling and formatting used are the 'H1' thru 'H6' tags, 'strong', 'em', and inline CSS formatting. The inline CSS style assisted in obtaining greater visual appearance and better control over the placement of objects.
